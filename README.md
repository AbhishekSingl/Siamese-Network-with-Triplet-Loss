# Siamese-Network-with-Triplet-Loss

Siamese network is very important concept in NLP and Computer Vision. Here, I've built a siamese network from scratch to get a understanding of how it works. 

Two implementations of Siamese Network for "Embedding Model":
* With Simple Model (with just few stacked Convolutional and Maxpooling layers) 
* Deep Convolution Model with one Inception block in-between.

Here's the few imagesnippets from the code:
## Batch of Triplets - Anchor, Positive and Negative

## TSNE result on MNIST using inception model.

# Requirements:
Tensorflow 2.0
Python 3
